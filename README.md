# Image_Generation_with_Pre-trained_Models

Overview
This project is part of my Generative AI internship with Prodigy Infotech, where I implemented and experimented with image generation using pre-trained models. Specifically, I utilized a pre-trained StyleGAN model, known for its ability to generate high-quality, realistic images.

Objectives
The main objectives of this task are:

To set up and configure a pre-trained GAN model for image generation.
To generate images from random noise using the model.
To visualize and save the generated images.

Conclusion
This project has been an exciting journey into the world of Generative Adversarial Networks and AI-driven image generation. By leveraging the power of the StyleGAN model, I have been able to generate high-quality, realistic images, showcasing the potential of AI in creative content generation.
